## Hello World

Shrikebyte is a small, independent consulting firm focused on delivering fast
FPGA and SoC systems. It consists of one employee, yours truly, and one very
supportive wife, who this business wouldn't be possible without (thanks Janey)!

I'm David Gussler, an experienced FPGA Engineer, who graduated with a Bachelors
in Electrical Engineering from Purdue University in West Lafayette, IN. I've
worked for the largest of
defense contractors, tiny three-person startups, and somewhere in-between
both of those at times throughout my career. I love chopping through
bureaucracy to get difficult work done, and I knew that I'd be perfectly positioned
to help do the same for other companies as an independent contractor.

I've been fortunate enough to have a few key customers encourage me to
start doing this full-time, so I took the plunge, and now here we are...

## Shrikebyte - What does it mean?

While I was musing over potential company names,
I also happened to be reading a book called Hyperion Cantos, by Dan Simmons.
This excellent si-fi novel features an absolutely menacing
character, the [Skrike](https://hyperioncantos.fandom.com/wiki/Shrike).

> The Shrike, also known as the Lord of Pain, Avatar, Angel of Final Atonement,
> Angel of Retribution or Angel of Retribution from Beyond Time, was a legendary
> and seemingly indestructible being of incredible power and strength, and of
> dauntingly imposing appearance, who was created in humanity's far future and
> sent back in time through the Time Tombs.

Angel of Final Atonement? Sheesh, what a title... Anyways, working with FPGAs
can occasionally feel like you're on a date
with the Lord of Pain, and Shrikebyte was founded to help me help others
tame that beast.
