# Welcome to Shrikebyte

We make FPGAs go fast, and we do it fast.

## About Us

### Our Mission

Shrikebyte was founded with a laser-focused mission: to reduce FPGA and SoC development timelines by engineering elegantly practical systems where budget, schedule, software and hardware all dance in congruent harmony.

### Our Philosophy

We believe the true potential of FPGA-based systems is unlocked when hardware and software are treated as partners, not bolted together as an afterthought. Aligning both from day one avoids costly rework and eliminates the inefficiencies that come from siloed teams. We approach every project with a systems-level mindset: translating high-level business goals into fast,
robust, and elegant digital solutions.

### Our Approach

We don't just focus on “our part” and leave the rest to someone else. We're outcome-driven, and we take responsibility for the full success of your system. To us, a design isn't just about checking boxes, it's about delivering a highly capable system that shatters expectations and doing it with more agility than anyone else.

### Our Guiding Principles

* Deliver FPGA / SoC designs that go fast, and do it fast.
* Your success is our success.
* Be [radically transparent](https://www.principles.com/principles/f6412dca-b3f9-4dd0-bb65-274869dd21ed).
* Have fun!
* Do difficult things that are worthwhile.
* Don't lie, cheat or steal.

## Our Services

* **Custom FPGA & SoC system design**
  Need to create something that's never been done before?
* **Support software & embedded Linux**
  We can develop drivers that open up a simple user API to the complicated underlying system. Good abstractions with shallow interfaces and deep capabilities open up the floodgates to exploiting powerful FPGA / software systems.
* **Turnkey projects**
  From start to finish, we develop requirements, orchestrate a high-level architecture, execute the implementation, rigorously verify and test, and assist with ongoing sustainment.
* **Specialized staff augmentation**
  Need specialized FPGA staff for a one-off project that doesn't justify a full-time hire? We have an expert at the who can immediately hit the ground running.
* **Prototype / demonstration systems**
  Need a proof-of-concept or development board prototype to explore design options and reduce risk before committing to a certain path?
* **Board design assistance**
  Never designed a custom FPGA board before? There are lots of pitfalls to watch out for, and we offer schematic design reviews to help catch problems before they make it to production.
* **Fixing and improving existing botched systems**
  We've all been there before. It's that terrifying codebase that everyone else is too afraid to touch because it's slowly devolved into such an incomprehensible mess and the last person to work on it retired 10 years ago. Let us clean it up and fix all those outstanding bugs.
* **Legacy design migration**
  Is it becoming more difficult to source parts for that 25-year-old board? We have the knowledge and experience needed to guide a smooth transition while upgrading to newer product generations.

## Technologies

These are some highlights of the technologies we are fluent in, along with a
few examples of past projects.

* **Software-Defined Radio**
  Development of a high-reliability, low-cost, jamming-resistant RF geolocation system using time-of-flight multilateration. Capable of locating aircraft to 5 m of precision at ranges up to 15 km.
* **Optical Communication**
  Design of an advanced free-space optics system, capable of delivering gigabit ethernet over an undetectable laser link.
* **Video Processing**
  Engineering of a sub-frame latency, real-time HD video pipeline using H.264 compression and Ethernet transmission.
* **Digital Signal Processing**
  Design of custom signal processing models and implementations to detect RF pulses in impossibly noisy environments. We're confident using common open-source industry-standard DSP prototyping tools like Numpy and Scipy.
* **Embedded Design**
  Need a specialized processor that can simultaneously control 100 serial devices without skipping a beat?
* **High Speed I/O Interfaces**, including
  * PCIe
  * Ethernet
  * MIPI
  * DDR Memories
  * Custom SERDES

## Contact Us

Want to talk about your project? Contact us any time and we can have a conversation to see if Shrikebyte is a good fit.

We'll never take on a project that we aren't suited for and we'll never recommend using an FPGA in a system where it doesn't make sense. If we're not the right fit, then we'll gladly help point you to another expert in our network who is more appropriate for your project's unique needs.
