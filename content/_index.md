# Welcome to Shrikebyte

We make FPGAs go fast, and we do it fast.

## About Us

### Our Mission

Shrikebyte was founded with a laser-focused mission: to reduce FPGA and SoC
development timelines by engineering elegantly practical systems where
budget, schedule, software and hardware all dance in congruent harmony.

### Our Philosophy

We believe the true potential of FPGA-based systems is unlocked when hardware
and software are treated as partners, not bolted together as an afterthought.
Aligning both from day one avoids costly rework and eliminates the
inefficiencies that come from siloed teams. We approach every project with
a systems-level mindset: translating high-level business goals into fast,
robust, and elegant digital solutions.

### Our Approach

We don't just focus on “our part” and leave the rest to someone else.
We're outcome-driven, and we take responsibility for the full success
of your system. To us, a design isn't just about checking boxes, its about
delivering a highly capable system that shatters our customers' expectations
and doing it with more agility than anyone else.

### Our Guiding Principles

- Deliver FPGA / SoC designs that go fast, and do it fast.
- Your success is our success.
- Be radically transparent and honest.
- Have fun.
- Do difficult things that are worthwhile.
- Don't lie, cheat or steal. There are no shortcuts in life.

## What The Heck is an FPGA?

An FPGA is a reconfigurable digital logic chip that is often used for highly
parallelized computing and for creating custom interfaces to bespoke hardware.
They're usually used in specialized, lower-volume systems with high thruput and or low latency
requirements like datacenter networking, RF / RADAR, aerospace & defense,
medical devices, scientific research, and test / measurement instrumentation.
Today, most of these systems benefit by pairing a standard processor to handle higher-level
tasks with an FPGA to handle lower-level tasks, and devices called SoCs
(System on a Chip) combine an FPGA with a standard processor on one chip,
allowing for tightly coupled and highly optimized interactions between hardware
and software. Having an expert in your corner who knows how to
tailor a well-balanced system is the best way to harness the power (and tame
the overwhelming complexities) of these highly capable devices.

Unlike with purely software-based projects, FPGA
systems can easily wreck a project's timeline, whether that be caused by
tool-bugs, unclear requirements, miscommunications between FPGA and software,
or completely unexplainable witchcraft, leading to a dark downward spiral into
the depths of [FPGA Hell](https://zipcpu.com/fpga-hell.html). Shrikebyte knows
how to navigate these pitfalls and keep your project on track. We're hyper-fixated
on solving tough problems. In a perfect world, problems would never happen,
but we have a practical worldview that helps us predict and then grapple with
your problems head on.

## Our Services

- Custom FPGA & SoC system design
  - Need to create something that's never been done before?
- Support software & OS development
- Turnkey projects
  - From start to finish, we develop requirements, orchestrate a high-level
    architecture, execute the implementation, rigorously verify and test, and
    assist with sustainment.
- Specialized staff augmentation
  - Need specialized FPGA staff for a one-off project that doesn't justify
    a full-time hire? We have experts at the ready that can immediately
    hit the ground running.
- Prototype / demonstration systems
  - Need a proof of system or development board prototype to explore design
    options and reduce risk before committing to a certain path?
- Board design assistance
  - Never designed a custom FPGA board before? There are lots of pitfalls to
    watch out for, and we offer schematic design reviews to help catch problems
    before they make it to production.
- Fixing and or improving existing botched systems
  - We've all been there before. Its that terrifying codebase that everyone
    else is too afraid to touch because it's slowly devolved into such an
    incomprehensible mess. Let us clean it up and fix all those
    outstanding bugs.
- Legacy design migration
  - Is it becoming more difficult to source parts for that 25-year old board?
    we have the knowledge and experience needed to guide a smooth transition
    while upgrading to newer product generations.

## Technologies

These are some hights of the technologies we are fluent in, along with a
few examples of past projects.

- Software-Defined Radio
  - Development of a high-reliability, low-cost, jamming-resistant radio
    frequency geolocation system based on RF time of flight measurement and
    multilateration principles, capable of locating an aircraft to 5 m of
    precision within a range of 15 km.
- Optical Communication
  - Design of an advanced free-space optics system, capable of delivering
    gigabit ethernet over an undetectable laser communications link.
- Video Processing
  - Engineering of an intricate, sub-frame latency, real-time video pipeline
    that compresses an HD camera feed with H.264 before transmitting over
    ethernet.
- Digital Signal Processing
  - Design of custom signal processing models and implementations to detect
    RF pulses in impossibly noisy environments. We're confident using
    common open-source industry-standard DSP prototyping tools like the
    well-regarded Python Numpy and Scipy libraries.
- Embedded Design
  - Need a specialized processor that can simultaneously control 100 UART
    devices without skipping a beat?
- High Speed IO interfaces, including
  - PCIe
  - Ethernet
  - MIPI
  - DDR Memories
  - Custom SERDES

## Contact Us

Want to talk about your project? Contact us any time and we can have a
conversation to see if Shrikebyte is a good fit.

We'll never take on a project that we aren't suited for or
recommend using an FPGA in a system where it doesn't make sense.
If we're not the right fit, then we'll gladly help point you to another expert
in our network who is more appropriate for your project's unique needs.
