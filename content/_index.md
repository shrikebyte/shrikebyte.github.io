# Welcome to Shrikebyte

We make FPGAs go fast, and we do it fast.

## About Us

### Our Mission

Shrikebyte was founded with a laser-focused mission: to reduce FPGA and SoC
development timelines by engineering elegantly practical systems where
budget, schedule, software and hardware all dance in congruent harmony.

### Our Philosophy

We believe the true potential of FPGA-based systems is unlocked when hardware
and software are treated as partners, not bolted together as an afterthought.
Aligning both from day one avoids costly rework and eliminates the
inefficiencies that come from siloed teams. We approach every project with
a systems-level mindset: translating high-level business goals into fast,
robust, and elegant digital solutions.

### Our Approach

We don't just focus on “our part” and leave the rest to someone else.
We're outcome-driven, and we take responsibility for the full success
of your system. To us, a design isn't just about checking boxes, it's about
delivering a highly capable system that shatters expectations
and doing it with more agility than anyone else.

### Our Guiding Principles

- Deliver FPGA / SoC designs that go fast, and do it fast.
- Your success is our success.
- Be [radically transparent](https://www.principles.com/principles/f6412dca-b3f9-4dd0-bb65-274869dd21ed).
- Have fun!
- Do difficult things that are worthwhile.
- Don't lie, cheat or steal. There are no shortcuts in life.

## What The Heck is an FPGA?

An FPGA is a reconfigurable digital logic chip often used for highly
parallelized computing and custom interfaces to bespoke hardware.
You'll usually find them in specialized, lower-volume systems where high throughput
or low latency is critical -
things like datacenter networking, RF/RADAR, aerospace & defense,
medical devices, scientific research, and test / measurement instrumentation.

FPGAs hit a sweet spot by delivering performance that pure software
can't match, without the up-front cost of an ASIC, all while retaining most of
the system flexibility offered by software. FPGAs also offers some
unique security features that make them attractive to specific markets.

Today, most FPGA-centric systems significantly benefit by pairing the FPGA with
a traditional processor (running either bare metal software, an OS like Linux, or both at the same time!) to
handle higher-level tasks while the FPGA handles lower-level tasks. Devices called SoCs
(System on a Chip) combine an FPGA with a traditional processor and peripherals on one chip,
allowing for tightly coupled and highly optimized interactions between hardware
and software. As we approach the end of [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)
this form of heterogeneous computing is becoming more and more important.

Having an expert in your corner who knows how to
tailor a well-balanced system is the best way to harness the power (and tame
the overwhelming complexities) of these highly capable SoC devices.

But with great power comes great... complexity.
FPGAs are notorious for wrecking project timelines, whether that be caused by
toolchain bugs, vague requirements, miscommunications between FPGA and software,
or outright
[unexplainable witchcraft](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39751509#:~:text=Unconventional%20Uses%20of%20FPGAs%20%7C%20Hacker%20News&text=%3E%20A%20ring%20oscillator%20in%20an,the%20ring%20oscillator%20will%20shift.),
leading to a dark downward spiral into
the depths of [FPGA Hell](https://zipcpu.com/fpga-hell.html).

Shrikebyte knows
how to navigate these pitfalls and keep your project on track. We're
hyper-fixated
on solving tough problems in the "messy middle" by aligning hardware and software
from the start. We have a practical worldview that helps us predict and grapple with
your problems head on.

## Our Services

- **Custom FPGA & SoC system design**
  Need to create something that's never been done before?
- **Support software & Embedded Linux**
  We can develop drivers that open up a simple user API to the complicated
  underlying system. Good abstractions with shallow interfaces and deep
  capabilities open up the floodgates to exploiting powerful FPGA / software systems.
- **Turnkey projects**
  From start to finish, we develop requirements, orchestrate a high-level
  architecture, execute the implementation, rigorously verify and test, and
  assist with ongoing sustainment.
- **Specialized staff augmentation**
  Need specialized FPGA staff for a one-off project that doesn't justify
  a full-time hire? We have an expert at the ready that can immediately
  hit the ground running.
- **Prototype / demonstration systems**
  Need a proof-of-concept or development board prototype to explore design
  options and reduce risk before committing to a certain path?
- **Board design assistance**
  Never designed a custom FPGA board before? There are lots of pitfalls to
  watch out for, and we offer schematic design reviews to help catch problems
  before they make it to production.
- **Fixing and improving existing botched systems**
  We've all been there before. It's that terrifying codebase that everyone
  else is too afraid to touch because it's slowly devolved into such an
  incomprehensible mess and the last person to work on it retired 10 years ago. Let us clean it up and fix all those
  outstanding bugs.
- **Legacy design migration**
  Is it becoming more difficult to source parts for that 25-year old board?
  We have the knowledge and experience needed to guide a smooth transition
  while upgrading to newer product generations.

## Technologies

These are some highlights of the technologies we are fluent in, along with a
few examples of past projects.

- **Software-Defined Radio**
  Development of a high-reliability, low-cost, jamming-resistant RF
  geolocation system using time-of-flight multilateration. Capable of
  locating aircraft to 5 m of precision at ranges up to 15 km.
- **Optical Communication**
  Design of an advanced free-space optics system, capable of delivering
  gigabit ethernet via an undetectable laser link.
- **Video Processing**
  Engineering of a sub-frame latency, real-time HD video pipeline using
  H.264 compression and Ethernet transmission.
- **Digital Signal Processing**
  Design of custom signal processing models and implementations to detect
  RF pulses in impossibly noisy environments. We're confident using
  common open-source industry-standard DSP prototyping tools like
  Numpy and Scipy.
- **Embedded Design**
  Need a specialized processor that can simultaneously control 100 UART
  devices without skipping a beat?
- **High Speed I/O interfaces**, including
  - PCIe
  - Ethernet
  - MIPI
  - DDR Memories
  - Custom SERDES

## Contact Us

Want to talk about your project? Contact us any time and we can have a
conversation to see if Shrikebyte is a good fit.

We'll never take on a project that we aren't suited for and we'll never
recommend using an FPGA in a system where it doesn't make sense.
If we're not the right fit, then we'll gladly help point you to another expert
in our network who is more appropriate for your project's unique needs.
